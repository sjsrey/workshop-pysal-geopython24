    "# Local Spatial Autocorrelation\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous chapter, we explored how global measures of spatial autocorrelation can help us determine whether the overall spatial distribution of our phenomenon of interest is compatible with a geographically random process. These statistics are useful: the presence of spatial autocorrelation has important implications for subsequent statistical analysis. From a substantive perspective, spatial autocorrelation could reflect the operation of processes that generate association between the values in nearby locations. This could represent *spillovers*, where outcomes at one site influence other sites; or it could indicate *contagion*, where outcomes at one site *causally influence* other sites. As we will see later in [Chapter 11](11_regression), it could simply be the result of systematic spatial variation (or, as we will call it then, _heterogeneity_). Spatial autocorrelation also sometimes arises from data measurement and processing. In this case, the dependence is a form of non-random noise rather than due to substantive processes. For example, when \"down-sampling\" geographic data, sometimes large patches of identical values can be created. These may only be artifacts of the interpolation, rather than substantive autocorrelation. Regardless of whether the spatial autocorrelation is due to substantive or nuisance sources, it is a form of non-randomness that complicates statistical analysis. For these reasons, the ability to determine whether spatial autocorrelation is present in a geographically referenced data set is a critical component of the geographic data science toolbox. \n",
    "\n",
    "Despite their importance, global measures of spatial autocorrelation are \"whole map\" statistics. They provide a single summary for an entire data set. For example,\n",
    "Moran's $I$ is a good tool to summarize a dataset into a single value that captures the degree of geographical clustering (or dispersion, if negative). However, Moran's $I$ does not indicate areas within the map where specific types of values (e.g., high, low) are clustered, or instances of explicit dispersion. \n",
    "In other words, Moran's I can tell us whether values in our map *cluster* together (or disperse) overall, but it will not inform us about where specific *clusters* (or outliers) are.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this chapter, we introduce local measures of spatial autocorrelation.\n",
    "Local measures of spatial autocorrelation focus on the relationships between _each_ observation and its surroundings, rather than providing a single summary of these relationships across the map. In this sense, they are not summary statistics but scores that allow us to learn more about the spatial structure in our data. The general intuition behind the metrics however is similar to that of global ones. Some of them are even mathematically connected, where the global version can be decomposed into a collection of local ones. One such example are Local Indicators of Spatial Association (LISAs) {cite}`Anselin1995local`, which we use to build the understanding of local spatial autocorrelation, and on which we spend a good part of the chapter. Once such concepts are clarified, we introduce a couple of alternative statistics that present complementary information or allow us to obtain similar insights for categorical data. Although very often these statistics are used with data expressed in geo-tables, there is nothing fundamentally connecting the two. In fact, the application of these methods to large surfaces is a promising area of work. For that reason, we close the chapter with an illustration of how one can run these statistics on data stored as surfaces."

    "## Local Moran's $I_i$\n",
    "\n",
    "One way to look at the figure above is as a classification of each observation in the dataset depending on its value and that of its neighbors. Furthermore, this classification is exhaustive: every point is assigned a label. But remember local measures help us to identify areas of _unusual_ concentration of values. Clusters will represent values of one type that are _unlikely_ to appear under the assumption of spatial randomness. To know whether each location belongs to a *statistically significant* cluster of a given kind, we thus need to compare it with what we would expect if the data were allocated over space in a completely random way. However, what we are interested in is whether the strength with which the values are concentrated is unusually high. This is exactly what LISAs are designed to do. A detailed description of the statistical underpinnings of LISAs is beyond the scope of this chapter. If you would like to delve deeper into the math and probability challenges arising, a good recent reference is {cite}`sauer2021ga`. In this context, we will provide some intuition about how they work in one LISA statistic, the local Moran's $I_i$. \n",
    "\n",
    "The core idea of a local Moran's $I_i$ is to identify cases in which the value of an observation and the average of its surroundings is either more similar (HH or LL in the scatterplot from Figure 3) or dissimilar (HL, LH) than we would expect from pure chance. The mechanism to do this is similar to the one in the global Moran's I, but it is applied in this case to each observation. This results in as many statistics as original observations. The formal representation of the statistic can be written as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "I_i = \\dfrac{z_i}{m_2} \\displaystyle\\sum_j w_{ij} z_j \\; ; \\; m_2 = \\dfrac{\\sum_i z_i^2}{n}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $m_2$ is the second moment (variance) of the distribution of values in the data, $z_i = y_i - \\bar{y}$, $w_{i,j}$ is the spatial weight for the pair of observations $i$ and $j$, and $n$ is the number of observations.\n",
    "\n",
    "LISAs are widely used in many fields to identify geographical clusters of values or find geographical outliers. They are a useful tool that can quickly return areas in which values are concentrated and provide suggestive evidence about the processes that might be at work. For these reasons, they have a prime place in the geographic data science toolbox. Among many other applications, LISAs have been used to identify geographical clusters of poverty {cite}`Dawson2018`, map ethnic enclaves {cite}`Johnston2010EPA`, delineate areas of particularly high/low economic activity {cite}`Torres2014`, or identify clusters of contagious disease {cite}`zhang2020`. The Local Moran's $I_i$ statistic is only one of a wide variety of LISAs that can be used on many different types of spatial data."

    "Because of their very nature, looking at the numerical result of LISAs is not always the most useful way to exploit all the information they can provide. Remember we are calculating a statistic for every single observation in the data so, if we have many of them, it will be difficult to extract any meaningful pattern. In this context, a choropleth can help. At first glance, this may seem to suggest that a choropleth of the $I_i$  values would be a useful way to visualize the spatial distribution. We can see such map in the top-left panel of the figure below and, while it tells us whether the local association is positive (HH/LL) or negative (HL/LH), it cannot tell, for example, whether the yellow areas in Scotland are similar to those in the eastern cluster of yellow areas. Are the two experiencing similar patterns of spatial association, or is one of them HH and the other LL? Also, we know that values around zero will not be statistically significant. Which local statistics are thus significant and which ones non-significant from a statistical point of view? In other words, which ones can be considered statistical clusters and which ones mere noise?\n",

To statistical significance, the bottom-left map distinguishes those polygons whose pseudo-$p$-value is above (_\"Non-Significant\"_) or below (_\"Significant\"_) the threshold value of 5% we use in this context.

Because some instances of the LISA statistics may not be statistically significant, we want to identify those with a p-value small enough that rules out the possibility of obtaining a similar value in random maps. A few different ways of generating random maps are considered by `esda`, but we focus on a strategy that actually simulates hundreds of thousands of random maps to get a rough idea of the possible local statistic values at each local authority given the data we saw. In addition, we follow a similar reasoning as with global Moran's I and use 5% as the threshold for statistical significance. To identify these values, we create a variable, `sig`, that contains `True` if the p-value of the observation satisfies the condition, and `False` otherwise.\n",

    "These cluster labels are meaningful if you know of the Moran Plot. To help making them a bit more intuitive, a terminology that is sometimes used goes as follows. Positive forms of local spatial autocorrelation are of two types. First, HH observations, which we can term as \"hot spots\", represent areas where values at the site and its surroundings are larger than average. Second, LL observations, significant clusters of low values surrounded by low values, are sometimes referred to as \"cold spots\". Negative forms of local spatial autocorrelation also include two cases. When the focal observation displays low values but its surroundings have high values (LH), we call them \"doughnuts\". Conversely, areas with high values but neighbored by others with low values (HL) can be referred to as \"diamonds in the rough\". We note this terminology is purely mnemonic, but recognize in some cases it can help in remembering the interpretation of local statistics. "

Naturally, this leads to the question: *why use the $G_i$ statistics at all?* The answer to this question is that the two sets of local statistics, local $I$ and local $G_i$, are complementary statistics. The local $I_i$ statistic (on its own) gives an indication of cluster/outlier status, and the local $G_i$ shows which side of the hotspot/coldspot divide the observation is on. Alternatively, the local Moran's $I_i$ cluster map provides both pieces of information, but it can be more challenging to visualize all at once.

As we have seen earlier in the book, more and more data for which we might want to explore local spatial autocorrelation are being provided as surfaces rather than geo-tables.

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "Local statistics are one of the most commonly-used tools in the geographic data science toolkit. When used properly, local statistics provide a powerful way to analyze and visualize the structure of geographic data. The Local Moran's $I_i$ statistic, as Local Indicator of Spatial Association, summarizes the co-variation between observations and their immediate surroundings. The Getis-Ord local $G$ statistics, on the other hand, compare the sum of values in the area around each site. Regardless, learning to use local statistics effectively is important for any geographic data scientist, as they are the most common \"first brush\" geographic statistic for many analyses. "

   "source": [
    "## Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Do the same Local Moran analysis done for `Pct_Leave`, but using `Pct_Turnout`. Is there a geography to how involved people were in different places? Where was turnout percentage (relatively) higher or lower? \n",
    "2. Do the same Getis-Ord analysis done for `Pct_Leave`, but using `Pct_Turnout`. \n",
    "3. Local Moran statistics are premised on a few distributional assumptions. One well-recognized concern with Moran statistics is when they are estimated for *rates*. Rate data is distinct from other kinds of data because it embeds the relationship between two quantities: the event and the population. For instance, in the case of Leave voting, the \"event\" is a person voting leave, and the \"population\" could be the number of eligible voters, the number of votes cast, or the total number of people. This usually only poses a problem for analysis when the event outcome is somehow dependent on the population. \n",
    "    - Using our past analytical steps, build a new `db` dataframe from `ref` and `lads` that contains the `Electorate`, `Votes_Cast`, and `Leave` columns. \n",
    "    - From this new dataframe, make scatterplots of:\n",
    "       - the number of votes cast and the percent leave vote\n",
    "       - the size of the electorate and the percent of leave vote\n",
    "    - Based on your answers to the previous point, does it appear that there is a relationship between the event and the population size? Use `scipy.stats.kendalltau` or `scipy.stats.pearsonr`  to confirm your visual intuition. \n",
    "    - Using `esda.moran.Moran_Rate`, estimate a global Moran's I that takes into account the rate structure of `Pct_Leave`, using the `Electorate` as the population. Is this estimate different from the one obtained without taking into account the rate structure? What about when `Votes_Cast` is used for the population? \n",
    "    - Using `esda.moran.Moran_Local_Rate`, estimate *local* Moran's I treating Leave data as a rate.\n",
    "        - does any site's local I change? Make a scatterplot of the `lisa.Is` you estimated before and this new rate-based local Moran. \n",
    "        - does any site's local I change their outlier/statistical significance classifications? Use `pandas.crosstab` to examine how many classifications change between the two kinds of statistic. Make sure to consider observations' statistical significances in addition to their quadrant classification.\n",
    "    - Make two maps, side-by-side, of the local statistics without rate correction and with rate correction. Does your interpretation of the maps change depending on the correction?\n",
    "4. Local statistics use *permutation-based* inference for their significance testing. This means that, to test the statistical significance of a local relationship, values of the observed variable are *shuffled* around the map. These large numbers of *random* maps are then used to compare against the observed map. Local inference requires some restrictions on how each shuffle occurs, since each observation must be \"fixed\" and compared to randomly-shuffle neighboring observations. The distribution of local statistics for each \"shuffle\" is contained in the `.rlisas` attribute of a Local Moran object. \n",
    "    - For the first observation, make a `seaborn.distplot` of its shuffled local statistics. Add a vertical line to the histogram using `plt.axvline()`. \n",
    "    - Do the same for the last observation as well. \n",
    "    - Looking only at their permutation distributions, do you expect the first LISA statistic to be statistically-significant? Do you expect the last?\n",
    "5. LISAs have some amount of fundamental uncertainty due to their estimation. This is called the `standard error` of the statistic.\n",
    "    - The standard errors are contained in the `.seI_sim` attribute. Make a map of the standard errors. Are there any areas of the map that appear to be more uncertain about their local statistics? \n",
    "    - compute the standard deviation of each observation's \"shuffle\" distribution, contained in the `.rlisas` attribute. Verify that the standard deviation of this shuffle distribution is the same as the standard errors in `seI_sim`. \n",
    "6. Local Getis-Ord statistics come in two forms. As discussed above, Getis-Ord $G_i$ statistics *omit* each site from their own local statistic. In contrast, $G_i^*$ statistics *include* the site in its own local statistic.\n",
    "    - make a scatterplot of the two types of statistic, contained in `gostats.Zs` and `gostars.Zs` to examine how similar the two forms of the Getis-Ord statistic are. \n",
    "    - the two forms of the Getis-Ord statistic differ by their inclusion of the *site* value, $y_i$, in the value for the $G_i$ statistic at that site. So, make a scatterplot of the percent leave variable and the *difference* of the two statistics. Is there a relationship between the percent leave vote and the difference in the two forms of the Getis-Ord statistic? Confirm this for yourself using `scipy.stats.kendalltau` or `scipy.stats.pearsonr`. \n",
